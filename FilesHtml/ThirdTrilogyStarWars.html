                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">The first part of the trilogy, Star Wars, episode VII:
                    The Force Awakens, takes place about 30 years after the Jedi Return events and includes new
                    characters, as well as characters from the original trilogy, including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo,
                    Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca44,45. This film, like the two following ones, is based on
                    an original scenario and not on a scenario resulting from the extended universe46.
                    The original cast joins newcomers John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac. It is
                    directed by J. J. Abrams who co-wrote the script with Lawrence Kasdan, co-author of the scenarios of
                    the Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. George Lucas advised J. J. Abrams as a creative
                    consultant; however, he was not involved in the film and according to a representative of the
                    creator of Star Wars, he would ideally not see a picture until he entered the cinema in December
                    201530,47,48 49. The film went into pre-production on October 30, 2012. Production began in April
                    201450; the film was released in December 2015.51 In the United States, the film is rated PG-13 "for
                    violent sci-fi and action scenes" 52. This is the second Star Wars movie to receive this warning
                    after Revenge of the Sith. The other films of the saga received a ranking "All Public" 53.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">Episode VIII: The Last Jedis (2017)</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">On June 20, 2014, Rian Johnson was chosen to write and
                    direct episode VIII of the saga and write the episode IX5,54. Kathleen Kennedy, Ram Bergman,
                    Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg are producers. Steve Yedlin is announced as Director of
                    Photography55. Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he was going to lead episode VIII56. The film
                    was released on December 13, 2017.

                    In March 2015, Oscar Isaac confirmed that he will resume his role as Poe Dameron in episode
                    VIII57,58,59. In July 2015, it was reported that Benicio del Toro was considered to play a villain
                    in episode VIII60,61; the actor later confirmed that he had been contacted62. In September 2015, it
                    was reported that Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tatiana Maslany, Gina Rodriguez and Olivia Cooke were on the list
                    of interesting actors in the production of the film63. On January 20, 2016, Disney pushes the
                    release of Star Wars VIII from 7 months to December 201764,65,66.

                    Like Episode VII, episode VIII is filmed at Pinewood Studios near London67,68. In an interview with
                    Wired, Abrams said the film's script was finished69. In September 2015, a few pre-production
                    shootings were held on Skellig Island Michael, Ireland, to take advantage of better weather
                    conditions70. The main shoot starts in January 2016 and ends in August 201667. Carrie Fisher, who
                    shot all her scenes for this film in the role of General Leia Organa, died of a heart attack at age
                    60 on December 27, 2016. Episode VIII will be the last episode of the saga in which the character of
                    Leia Organa will appear because the production of the film and Lucasfilm have made it clear during
                    an interview given a few days after the death of the actress that the character would not not
                    recreated numerically by computer images in episode IX, ultimate episode of this third trilogy71.

                <p style="text-align: justify" class="card-text">On August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was announced as
                    director of episode IX6. Like the two previous opus, Episode IX will be shot in 35mm72 format. But
                    after creative differences73, Trevorrow left the project in 2017.7 J.J. Abrams took over as
                    director74.

                    After the death of Carrie Fisher aka Leia Organa, in December 2016, the film is completely
                    altered75.
